# H3D virtual screening cascade light

This panel of models provides predictions for the H3D virtual screening cascade. It leverages the Ersilia Compound Embedding and FLAML. The H3D virtual screening cascade contains models for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum IC50 predictions, as well as ADME, cytotoxicity and solubility assays

This model was incorporated on 2023-05-09.
